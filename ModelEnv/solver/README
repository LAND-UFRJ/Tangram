Usage: solv <choice> <basename> [precision]

choice:    1- Gauss-Siedel, 2- Jacobi, 3- SOR, 4- Power Method
           5- GTH without partitions, 6- GTH with partitions 
           7- Uniformization (transient measure)
basename:  transition matrix filename without the extension (.generator_mtx)
precision: error bound for iterative and transient methods (1, 2, 3, 4 and 7)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
GTH block elimination solution:

In option 6, solv program reads a partition description file named
"basename.partition" of the form:

number of partitions
(in crescent order)
final state of the first partition
...
final state of the ith partition
or a definition of blocks with the same size:
"s " block size " " final state of the last block
...

The final state of the last block must be the equal to the dimension of the
chain.

Ex: 4 partitions where the last 3 have a size of 2 (final states of each
block are 3, 5, 7 and 9, in crescent order).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Uniformization method (transient point probability):

In option 7, solv program reads an initial probability description file, 
named "basename.init_prob" and a time intervals description file named
"basename.intervals".

The initial probability description file is of the form:

state probability
or a definition of an equiprobable block:
"e " initial state of the block " " end state of the block

Ex: 5 states with the last 3 with equal probabilities.

1 1.0e-01
2 3.0e-01
e 3 5 2.0e-01


The time intervals description file is of the form:

number of time intervals
(in crescent order)
first time interval
...
ith time interval
or a definition of an equispaced range of time intervals:
"n " total time interval of the range " " number of points in the range
...

Ex: 6 time intervals with an equispaced range between 2.0 and 8.0
(time intervals are 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0 and 9.5).
