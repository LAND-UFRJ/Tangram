It was a pleasure to see their enthusiasm.\nBelow we\nacknowledge the people who contributed to the tool and indicate the main parts\nthey were involved with.\n\nThe modeling paradigm was conceived by Dr. Steven Berson,\nProf. Edmundo de Souza e Silva and Prof. Richard Muntz in 1989.\nThis paradigm was adopted by the TANGRAM tool developed in 1989 and\nled by Richard Muntz.\n\nThe TANGRAM-II modeling environment was conceived by \nProf. Edmundo de Souza e Silva and Prof. Rosa Maria Le\u00e3o.\nProf. Richard Muntz participated as a major consultant\nand in the discussions that led to the TANGRAM-II project.\nThe current principal investigators are Edmundo de Souza e Silva and\nRosa Maria Le\u00e3o.\n\nThe drawing interface adopted by TANGRAM-II is the same as\nthat conceived for TANGRAM (TGIF) and was developed by Dr. William Cheng.\nSeveral goodies were included in TGIF to support the needs of TANGRAM-II.\nDr. Cheng implemented the modifications in TGIF and participated\nin the design discussions.\n\nThe first version of the mathematical model generator \nwas implemented by Luiz Rogerio G. de Carvalho in 1997.\nThis model was completely re-designed and re-implemented by\nDaniel Ratton Figueiredo and Carlos F. de Brito.\nThe re-design included many new constructs that were added to the\nTANGRAM-II language, and reward-based measures.\nThe hash function and AVL tree was implemented by Magnos Martinello.\n\nThe analytical solvers were designed/coded by: Yuguang Wu, Jo\u00e3o Carlos Guedes,\nMorganna Carmem Diniz, Edmundo de Souza e Silva, Carlos F. de Brito,\nJo\u00e3o Abdalla and Ana Paula Couto da Silva.\nThe simulator was designed by Daniel Ratton Figueiredo, and\nthe FARIMA and FBM modules were implemented by \nAdenilson Raniery S. Pontes (under the guidance of Prof. Rosangela Coelho).\n\nThe module that calculates/plots measures of interest based on state\nprobabilities was implemented by Antonio Mauricio N. Tartarini.\nThe JAVA interfaces were designed and implemented by\nKelvin de Freitas Reinhardt, Adriane de Quevedo Cardozo and\nFlavio Pimentel Duarte.\nThey also have been including new features since 1999.\nThe interfaces between the solvers and the JAVA screens was re-designed\nby Sidney Cunha de Lucena. \nThe module used to visualize and permute matrices was designed\nand implemented by Fernando Jorge Silveira Filho and \nDaniel Sadoc Menasche.\n\nThe TANGRAM-II simulator (that includes support for rare event simulation)\nwas designed and implemented by Daniel Ratton Figueiredo.\nKelvin de\nFreitas Reinhardt implemented new features to support fluid simulation\nwith the help of Bruno F. Martins Ribeiro.\nThe TANGRAM-II parser has been improved and maintained by\nJorge Allyson Azevedo, Guilherme D. G.\nJaime and Flavio Pimentel Duarte.\n\nThe traffic modeling environment was implemented by Sidney Cunha de Lucena.\nThe traffic generator was implemented by Daniel Ratton Figueiredo,\nCarlos F. de Brito and Magnos Martinello.\nFabiano de Azevedo\nPortella participated in the implementation of its user interfaces as well as\nthe program for calculating traffic measures from the Tangram-II traffic\ntrace format.\nMagnos Martinello implemented the traffic \ngenerator interface to ATM switches. Antonio A. de Arag\u00e3o Rocha implemented\nnew traffic generation features and options that were added to the\n3.0 version of Tangram-II. Hugo Sato worked on the graphical interfaces\nfor these new features.\n\nThe first version of the Whiteboard Tool was designed and implemented by \nEdmundo de Souza e Silva, William Cheng, Renato Santana,\nCarlos F. de Brito, Magnos Martinello, Raphael S. de Moraes,\nDenise Jorge de Oliveira and Flavio Pimentel Duarte.\nThe develop team of the second version of the Whiteboard Tool was:\nEdmundo de Souza e Silva, William Cheng, Jorge Allyson Azevedo, Milena \nScanferla and Daniel Sadoc.\n\nParticipated in the implementation of the voice tool, VivaVoz:\nDaniel Ratton Figueiredo, Flavio Pimentel Duarte.\nCarolina Vielmond and Edmundo Gr\u00fcne\nde Souza e Silva have implemented a graphical user interface for VivaVoz\nits voice mixer, a new trace colector, and are now the tool's current\nmaintainers.\n\nAna Paula Couto da Silva was responsible for the examples and the TANGRAM-II\ntutorial, based on the contribution of many people, including those above.\nDaniel Figueiredo was the project leader till mid 1999, and he still\nacts as a consultant.\nKelvin de Freitas Reinhardt, Adriane de Quevedo\nCardozo, and Flavio Pimentel Duarte have been responsible for putting\nversion 1.2-6 together and several subsequent versions. For version 3.0,\nCarolina Vielmond and Hugo Sato created the autotools scripts that enable\nthe Tangram-II source code to be compiled on several Linux plattaforms.\n\nWe would like to thank our colleagues from the ALMADEM and COMIT projects:\nProf. Berthier Ribeiro Neto, Dr. Jorge Moreira,\nProf. Paulo Aguiar, Prof. Rosangela Coelho, Prof. Jose Augusto Suruagy Monteiro,\nProf. Sergio Campos, Prof. Nelson Fonseca,\nProf. Leana Golubchik and Prof. Don Towsley\nfor the insightful discussions that led to many enhancements of TANGRAM-II.\n\nWe are in debt to Prof. Virgilio Almeida and Mr. Celso Deusdeti Costa\nfrom ProTem/CC (CNPq) who believed in the work of our group.\nCNPq (ProTem, Pronex, Free Software programs) and FAPERJ provided the\nmain grants that supported our Laboratory.\n\n-----------\nLAND: [L]aboratory for Modeling/[An]alysis and [D]evelopment of Computer\n      and Communications Systems\nUFRJ: Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\nhttp://www.land.ufrj.br\n\n");
