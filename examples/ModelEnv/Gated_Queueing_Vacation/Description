This model  describes a system  with  a Poisson source that  generates
packets to a queue. The queue serves the packets if and only if it has
the token  (generate by   the  Token_Passer  object). When the   queue
receives the token, it closes the "gate" and  serves the packets until
the  timeout expires (the  queue continues receiving packets, but they
are  stored behind the gate).   If  some packets are  not served, they
must wait the next token arrival.
