This directory contains two files: histogram_source.obj (a traffic model) and 
traffic_source.trace (a traffic source trace).

It is possible to obtain traffic descriptors (autocorrelation, IDC, mean, etc)
from both the model and the trace.

The histogram_source.obj is a traffic source model. The rate reward associated
with the traffic source object represents the source rate.

Each line of the file traffic_source.trace represents the traffic source rate
collected at fixed intervals of time.
