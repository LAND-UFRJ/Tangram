This model represents a  $2X2$ output queue ATM  switch architecture.
In this model, when the packet arrives at the switch it is immediately
routed to the appropriate output channel and no blocking occurs in the
switch fabrics.
There are two On_Off sources that transmits packets to the Switch_2x2 object.
